# EvolutionaryGames ðŸŽ®

A project designed for Computational Intelligence course. <br> <br>
In this project, a simple 2D minigame is implemented. <br>
The agent needs to learn to maneuver via neural network + evolution.

This project is an implementation of an Evolutionary Games intelligent agent using neural network and evolution algorithm. The agent is able to learn to play a variety of one-player games, by evolving a population of neural networks that adapt to the game dynamics over time.

- detailed instruction of project is available in `Evaluation Project.pdf`.
